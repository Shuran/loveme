## What is IceLink for Xamarin?

IceLink for Xamarin allows you to add core audio/video capabilities to your Xamarin application â€“ capabilities that you can control from within your application. IceLink complies with the WebRTC standard so your Xamarin applications can interact seamlessly and plugin-free with WebRTC-enabled browsers like Chrome, FireFox and Opera.

## Complete audio and video engines.

IceLink implements the WebRTC standard for audio/video streams, including media capture, media playback, stream formatting, RTP/RTCP packet processing, audio/video encoding/decoding (Opus, G.711, VP8), and more.

## Use any signalling system.

As IceLink follows the WebRTC standard, it requires a separate signalling mechanism to locate the peer before it can establish a peer-to-peer connection. Signalling for IceLink is provided by Frozen Mountain's WebSync product or your own application if you already have a real-time messaging component (an XMPP or WebSocket library, for example). The samples included in this component use a public WebSync signalling engine running continuously on Frozen Mountain's servers.

## Cross-platform support.

IceLink is available for all major desktop (PC, Mac, Linux), mobile (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), and web platforms (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera).
