In using TDD method, compilation always comes with first priority, because incomplete functionality can always be bookmarked
and develpers can always come back later. Therefore, the good habit is to fulfill functionality with simplest implementation
and mark with TODO, and come back later.

For example,
//TODO-working-on: Obtain the user information from remote server
//TODO-suspend: Construct the mGlobalInfoManager Object
//TODO-suspend: Construct the mUserServiceRemote Object
//TODO-working-on: Bind the name and password parameters
ServiceAndManagerLoader.mGlobalInfoManager.mCurrentUser = await ServiceAndManagerLoader.mUserServiceRemote.GetUser(name,password);

In this piece of code, mCurrentUser and GetUser functions are not functional, but compilation goes through.
And if we navigate into where the implementation should be for these two object/function, there is a TODO mark there.
