When developing a feature, take into consideration of the follwing states of the app:
<1> The app is resumed from pause (RESUME)
<2> The app is restarted (RESTART)
<3> The app is deleted and re-installed (REINSTALL)
<4> The app is newly installed (INSTALL)
<5> The app is installed in a new device with another instance running in another device (PARAINSTALL)
<6> No Internet (NOINT)

The feature is called "complete" only when the six scenarios above have been taken into full consideration and implemented.
